# How to create ubuntu os image for ( example ) k8s

### This installer not finished at all, there are just bunch of script and config ...
<br>
Probably if you run creator.sh will create a container with correct apps and create a ubuntu os image without config anything ( like ubuntu:ubuntu user with pass )
<br>
<br>
Current config of k8s cluster at in autoinstall.config.yaml, but I lost everything <br>
in a "tmp" folder, so it is only a saved config file from the servers, but I think it can be used in the future !
